# Handoff Matrix

Artifact flow, signal routing, precedence rules, and budget constraints across the skill pipeline.

## Artifact Flow

| Producing Skill | Artifact | Consuming Skill(s) |
|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| `plan-interview` | `docs/plans/plan-NNN-<slug>.md` | `intent-framed-agent` (context), `context-surfing` (wave anchor), `agent-teams` (task extraction) |
| `intent-framed-agent` | Intent Frame (in-session) | `context-surfing` (wave anchor), handoff files on exit |
| `context-surfing` | `.context-surfing/handoff-[slug]-[timestamp].md` | Next session (resume), `plan-interview` (replanning input) |
| `simplify-and-harden` | `learning_loop.candidates` (YAML) | `self-improvement` (pattern logging) |
| `simplify-and-harden-ci` | PR comment + check run + YAML findings | `self-improvement-ci` (recurrence tracking) |
| `agent-teams` | Learning loop candidates (same format as S&H) | `self-improvement` (cross-team pattern aggregation) |
| `self-improvement` | `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md`, `.learnings/ERRORS.md` | Promotion targets: `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |

## Signal Routing

| Signal | Source | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Task classified | `skill-pipeline` | Activate appropriate skills |
| Plan approved by user | `plan-interview` | Auto-start execution (no "proceed" confirmation) |
| Planning-to-execution transition | User cues ("go ahead", "implement this") | Activate `intent-framed-agent` |
| Intent frame + plan established | `intent-framed-agent` + `plan-interview` | `context-surfing` auto-activates |
| Task completion (exit code 0, PR ready) | Implementation | Activate `simplify-and-harden` (if non-trivial diff) |
| Intent Resolution emitted | `intent-framed-agent` | Signal `simplify-and-harden` readiness |
| Drift exit (strong signal) | `context-surfing` | Stop execution, write handoff file, notify user |
| Weak drift signal | `context-surfing` | Recovery protocol (re-anchor, reconcile, escalate if uncertain) |
| Intent Check fired | `intent-framed-agent` | Pause, evaluate scope, user decides |
| Error, correction, knowledge gap | Any skill | Activate `self-improvement` |
| Learning promotion threshold met | `self-improvement` | Update CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / copilot-instructions.md |

## Precedence Rules

1. **context-surfing exit > intent-framed-agent Intent Check** — If both fire simultaneously, resolve context degradation first. Degraded context makes scope checks unreliable.
2. **simplify-and-harden re-entry guard** — The skill does not run twice on the same task. No re-entry loops.
3. **Plan-interview is a human gate** — Never auto-invoke. Recommend when task classifies as Large, but user decides.
4. **Quality gates are non-negotiable** (for agent-teams): clean compile, tests pass, exit condition met, no TODO/FIXME without tasks.

## Budget Constraints

| Skill | Constraint | Value |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| `simplify-and-harden` | Max additional diff | 20% of original diff size |
| `simplify-and-harden` | Max execution time | 60 seconds |
| `agent-teams` | Max audit rounds | 3 |
| `agent-teams` | Diff growth cap | 30% above original implementation diff |
| `agent-teams` | Agent sizing (small codebase) | 1-2 impl + 2 auditors |
| `agent-teams` | Agent sizing (medium codebase) | 2-3 impl + 2-3 auditors |
| `agent-teams` | Agent sizing (large codebase) | 3-5 impl + 3 auditors |
| `simplify-and-harden` | Document pass | Max 5 comments |

## Context File Loading

From `context-surfing`, always load at activation:
- `CLAUDE.md` — agent configuration, conventions, constraints
- `AGENTS.md` — multi-agent setup, role definitions
- `README.md` — project intent and structure
- Any `.md` in project root

Load on demand when relevant:
- `.md` files in `skills/`, `docs/`, `.learnings/`
- `SKILL.md` files for skills being invoked

## Learning Loop Integration

Pattern keys emitted by code review skills:
- **Simplify:** `simplify.dead_code`, `simplify.naming`, `simplify.control_flow`, `simplify.over_abstraction`
- **Harden:** `harden.input_validation`, `harden.authorization`, `harden.error_handling`, `harden.injection_vectors`, `harden.secrets_exposure`

Promotion threshold: recurrence count >= 3, seen across >= 2 distinct tasks, within 30-day window.
